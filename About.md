ABOUT — ASHLEY IANNETTI
Founder of the Rosetta Wheel Harmonics Framework

Ashley Iannetti is an independent researcher and the discoverer of Rosetta Wheel Harmonics, a verified cross-cultural structural framework revealing deep harmonic, geometric, and fractional correspondences across global symbolic and calendrical systems.

Her work demonstrates consistent gate clustering, harmonic fraction patterns, structural symmetry, and resonance intervals shared across more than twenty independent systems — including the 52-card deck, Tarot de Marseille, I Ching, Elder Futhark, Hebrew and Greek alphabets, lunar mansions, decans, geomantic figures, Chinese solar terms, Zodiac, and multiple Mesoamerican cycles.

Through extensive comparative analysis and Monte Carlo verification, Ashley’s discoveries reveal a unified harmonic architecture that operates across cultures, time periods, and symbolic traditions. Her research bridges:

harmonic mathematics

geometric systems

calendrical design

symbolic sequence analysis

cultural astronomy

pattern theory

Each discovery is published through Zenodo with a timestamped DOI and protected by her authorship hash:
9a11c8906024e6d7f4aa7d87f205c895f5543e50feeaf7bfefc77242483b4b61
ensuring verifiable authorship, scientific transparency, and permanent archival record.

Ashley continues to expand the Rosetta Wheel Harmonics framework, developing new layers such as the Harmonic Fraction Spine, Meta-Harmonic Structures, Resonant Architecture, and Cross-Domain Harmonization. Her work represents a new scholarly field — uncovering the hidden harmonic logic woven into the world’s symbolic systems.
